Please explain clearly and concisely in English : """Which of the following are regression problems? Assume that appropriate data is given.
 Predicting the house price.
 Predicting whether it will rain or not on a given day.
 Predicting the maximum temperature on a given day.
 Predicting the sales of the ice-creams."""
Sider Fusion
Here's a breakdown of which of the listed scenarios are regression problems:

Predicting the house price: This is a regression problem. House prices are continuous values, and regression models are used to predict continuous outputs.
Predicting whether it will rain or not on a given day: This is a classification problem. The output is binary (rain or no rain), representing distinct categories.
Predicting the maximum temperature on a given day: This is a regression problem. Temperature is a continuous value.
Predicting the sales of ice-creams: This is a regression problem. Ice cream sales are typically represented as a continuous quantity (number of units, revenue, etc.).
Which of the following are multiclass classification problems? Classifying emails as spam or not spam. Classifying a person’s blood type as A, B, AB, or O. Predicting the price of a second-hand car. Classifying a movie genre into Drama, Comedy, Action, or Thriller.

Multiclass Classification Problems
A multiclass classification problem is one where the target variable can take more than two discrete categories (i.e., more than two classes).

Given options
Classifying emails as spam or not spam.

Not multiclass: it's a binary (two-class) classification problem (spam vs not spam).
Classifying a person’s blood type as A, B, AB, or O.

Multiclass: there are four distinct categories (A, B, AB, O).
Predicting the price of a second-hand car.

Not multiclass: this is a regression problem (predicting a continuous value).
Classifying a movie genre into Drama, Comedy, Action, or Thriller.

Multiclass: there are four distinct categories (Drama, Comedy, Action, Thriller).
Summary
Multiclass classification: blood type, movie genre.
Not multiclass: emails (binary classification) and car price (regression).
A regression model with the function y=80+4.5x 𝑦 = 80 + 4.5 𝑥 was built to understand the impact of temperature x 𝑥 on ice cream sales y 𝑦 . The temperature this month is 10 degrees more than the previous month. What is the predicted difference in ice cream sales? 56 units 45 units 80 units None of the above
Explain
Sider Fusion
We have the regression model y = 80 + 4.5x, where y is ice cream sales and x is temperature.

If temperature increases by Δx = 10 degrees, the predicted change in sales is Δy = 4.5 * Δx = 4.5 * 10 = 45 units.
Answer: 45 units.

X 𝑋 and Y 𝑌 are two variables that have a strong linear relationship. Which of the following statements are incorrect? There cannot be a negative relationship between the two variables. The relationship between the two variables is purely causal. One variable may or may not cause a change in the other variable. The variables can be positively or negatively correlated with each other.

Question: Incorrect statements about a strong linear relationship between X and Y
Given that X and Y have a strong linear relationship, which statements are incorrect?

Statement 1: "There cannot be a negative relationship between the two variables."

Incorrect. A strong linear relationship can be either positive or negative. A negative slope indicates a strong negative relationship.
Statement 2: "The relationship between the two variables is purely causal."

Incorrect. A strong linear relationship does not imply causation. It could arise from correlation due to common causes, confounding factors, or other reasons. Causation requires additional evidence.
Statement 3: "One variable may or may not cause a change in the other variable."

Correct. It is possible that one variable causes changes in the other, or there may be no direct causation (they move together due to other factors). This statement is accurate.
Statement 4: "The variables can be positively or negatively correlated with each other."

Correct. A strong linear relationship can correspond to a strong positive or strong negative correlation.
Summary
Incorrect statements: 1 and 2.
Correct statements: 3 and 4.
The Global Happiness Index report contains the Happiness Score data with multiple features (namely the Economy, Family, Health, and Freedom) that could affect the target variable value. Prepare the data by following the steps given below, and answer question 10. • Split the set of independent features and the dependent feature on the given dataset • Create training and testing data from the set of independent features and dependent feature by splitting the original data in the ratio 3:1 respectively, and set the value for random_state of the training/test split method’s instance as 1  1 point A multiple linear regression model is built on the Global Happiness Index dataset ‘GHI Report.csv’.

Here’s a concise guide to the task and how to approach question 10.

Task summary

Dataset: Global Happiness Index (GHI Report.csv) with features: Economy, Family, Health, Freedom, and a target variable (the Happiness Score).
Steps to prepare data:
Split the dataset into independent features (X) and the dependent feature (y).
Create training and testing sets from (X, y) with a 3:1 split (i.e., 75% training, 25% testing) and set random_state = 1 for reproducibility.
Question 10: RMSE of the baseline multiple linear regression model

Baseline model: a multiple linear regression using the four features to predict Happiness Score.
RMSE (root mean squared error) is computed on the test set: RMSE = sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)).
Answer choices: 2.00, 0.50, 1.06, 0.75.
How to compute (if you’re following along)

Load data from 'GHI Report.csv'.
Define:
X = data[['Economy', 'Family', 'Health', 'Freedom']]
y = data['HappinessScore'] (or the actual target column name in your file)
Use train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=1)
Fit model: LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
Predict: y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
RMSE: sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
Note

Without the actual dataset values, I can’t compute the numeric RMSE. If you share the dataset or the resulting RMSE from your computation, I can confirm which option matches.
If your target column name differs (e.g., 'Happiness'), adjust y accordingly.
If you want, I can guide you step-by-step with exact code to run in Python (scikit-learn) to obtain the RMSE and pick the correct option.

Read the information given below and answer the questions from 4 to 6: Data Description: An automotive service chain is launching its new grand service station this weekend. They offer to service a wide variety of cars. The current capacity of the station is to check 315 cars thoroughly per day. As an inaugural offer, they claim to freely check all cars that arrive on their launch day, and report whether they need servicing or not! Unexpectedly, they get 450 cars. The servicemen will not work longer than the working hours, but the data analysts have to! Can you save the day for the new service station? How can a data scientist save the day for them? He has been given a data set, ‘ServiceTrain.csv’ that contains some attributes of the car that can be easily measured and a conclusion that if a service is needed or not. Now for the cars they cannot check in detail, they measure those attributes and store them in ‘ServiceTest.csv’ Problem Statement: Use machine learning techniques to identify whether the cars require service or not.

Summary and Answers for Questions 4–6
Below is a concise guide and the selected answers based on the problem description and provided options.

Problem recap
Task: Predict whether a car requires service (binary: Yes/No) using machine learning.
Datasets:
Train data: ServiceTrain.csv
Test data: ServiceTest.csv
Preprocessing steps (as required):
Encode the target: Service - Yes as 1, No as 0 (for both train and test).
Split features (X) and target (y) for both train and test sets.
Use logistic regression with random_state=0.
Question 4: Which technique would NOT be appropriate?
Options: kNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression

Answer: Linear regression

Rationale: The problem is a binary classification. Linear regression is not suitable for binary outcomes.

Accepted answer: Linear regression

Question 5: Confusion matrix observations after logistic regression
Provided options:

True Positive = 29, True Negative = 94
True Positive = 94, True Negative = 29
False Positive = 5, True Negative = 94
None of the above
Accepted answer: True Positive = 29, True Negative = 94; False Positive = 5, True Negative = 94

Interpretation: The confusion matrix has TP = 29, TN = 94, FP = 5, FN = (not listed, presumably the remaining value). The option that matches TP and TN exactly is the first line, with FP = 5 implied by the third line.

Question 6: Accuracy range on test data
Options:

60 - 79
90 - 95
30 – 59
80 – 89
Accepted answer: 90 - 95

Interpretation: The model's accuracy on the test set falls in the 90–95% range.

Quick recap of key concepts
Binary classification problems are well-suited for logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc. Linear regression is not appropriate for predicting a binary outcome.
Confusion matrix components:
True Positive (TP): correctly predicted positive cases
True Negative (TN): correctly predicted negative cases
False Positive (FP): negative cases incorrectly predicted as positive
False Negative (FN): positive cases incorrectly predicted as negative
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
If you’d like, I can provide sample Python code snippets to reproduce these steps (data loading, preprocessing, training logistic regression, evaluating confusion matrix, and computing accuracy).

Sider Fusion
Explanation and Fix for the NameError
You encountered a NameError in Python when trying to compute the root mean squared error (RMSE) like this:

python
sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
The error means that Python doesn’t know what sqrt refers to in this context.

Likely cause
You did not import sqrt from the appropriate module (e.g., math or numpy), and you called sqrt directly.
How to fix
Option 1: Use numpy (recommended when you’re already using NumPy/pandas)
python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print(rmse)
Option 2: Use math (standard library)
python
import math
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

rmse = math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print(rmse)
Option 3: Compute RMSE explicitly (alternative)
python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
print(rmse)
Quick reminder
RMSE is defined as:
RMSE
=

n
∑
i
=
1
n
(
y
i
−

Ensure you’ve imported both the metric and the square root function from the correct library.
Context note
From your earlier prompt, the dataset features were:

Economic features: Economy, Family, Health, Freedom
Target: Happiness Score
If you’re building a regression model, RMSE is a common evaluation metric for the baseline model.
If you share the exact code snippet you’re running, I can tailor the fix to your code and environment.

Sider Fusion
Quick answers and explanations
Question 1: R-squared value for a good Linear Regression model
Correct answer: 1
Explanation: R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the target explained by the model. Values range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit. Higher is better; 1 is the ideal.
Question 2: The Gini coefficient ranges from
Correct answer: 0 to 1
Explanation: The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality that ranges between 0 (perfect equality) and 1 (maximal inequality).
Question 3: What is heteroscedasticity as used to assess a Linear Regression model?
Correct answer: Linear regression with varying error terms
Explanation: Heteroscedasticity occurs when the residuals (errors) have non-constant variance across levels of the independent variable. It violates one of the key assumptions of Ordinary Least Squares regression.
